# RLLaMA

RLLaMA is a pure Rust implementation of [LLaMA large language model inference.](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/).

## Supported features

  * Uses either `f16` and `f32` weights.
  * LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA-30B, LLaMA-65B all confirmed working
  * Hand-optimized AVX2 implementation
  * OpenCL support for GPU inference.
  * Simple HTTP API support, with the possibility of doing token sampling on
    client side

## Performance

The current performance is as follows:

## Install

You can install with `cargo` tool. RLLaMA uses intrinsics extensively and you
likely need to enable them to install the executable.

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+sse2,+avx,+fma,+avx2" cargo install rllama
```

There is a `.cargo/config.toml` inside this repository that will enable these
features if you install manually from this Git repository instead.

## LLaMA weights

Refer to https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/ As of now, you need to be
approved to get weights.

For LLaMA-7B make sure, you got these files:

```shell
* 7B/consolidated.00.pth
* 7B/params.json
* tokenizer.model
```

The `consolidated.00.pth` is actually a zip file. You need to unzip it:

```shell
$ cd 7B
$ unzip consolidated.00.pth
$ mv consolidated consolidated.00
```

If you are using a larger model like LLaMA-13B, then you can skip the last step
of renaming the `consolidated` directory.

You should now be ready to generate some text.

## Example

Run LLaMA-7B with some weights casted to 16-bit floats:

```shell
rllama --tokenizer-path /path/to/tokenizer.model \
       --model-path /path/to/LLaMA/7B \
       --param-path /path/to/LLaMA/7B/params.json \
       --f16 \
       --prompt "The meaning of life is"
```

Use `rllama --help` to see all the options.

## Interactive mode

There is a simple experimental interactive mode to try force a type of
back-and-forth discussion with the model.

```shell
rllama ... --start-interactive \
           --interactive-prompt-postfix " AI:" \  # (optional)
           --interactive-stop "Human: "           # (optional but you probably want to set it)
```

In this mode, you need to type your prompt before the AI starts doing its work.
If the AI outputs token sequence given in `--interactive-stop` (defaults to
`[EOF]`) then it will ask for another input. You probably want to have `"Human:
"` or something similar, see example below.

`--interactive-prompt-postfix` is appended automatically to your answers. You
can use this to force the AI to follow a pattern. Here is a full example of
interactive mode command line:

```shell
rllama --f16 \
       --param-path /LLaMA/7B/params.json \
       --model-path /LLaMA/7B \
       --tokenizer-path /stonks/LLaMA/tokenizer.model \
       --prompt "This is an interactive session between human and AI assistant. AI: Hi! How can I help you? Human:" \
       --start-interactive \
       --interactive-stop "Human:" \
       --interactive-prompt-postfix " AI:"
```

## Inference server

`rllama` can run in an inference server mode with a simple HTTP JSON API. You
need to enable `server` features for this.

```
cargo build --release --features server
```

The command line flags for this are:

  * `--inference-server` using this will turn on the inference server.
  * `--inference-server-port` sets the port. Default port is 8080.
  * `--inference-server-host` sets the host. The default host is 127.0.0.1.
  * `--inference-server-max-concurrent-inferences` sets how many concurrent
    requests are allowed to be actively doing inference at the same time. The
    default is 5.
  * `--inference-server-api-path` sets which path servers the API requests. The
    default path is `/rllama/v1/inference`
  * `--inference-server-prompt-cache-size` sets how many previous prompt
    calculations should be cached. Default is 50. This speeds up token
    generation for prompts that were already requested before, however it also
    increases memory use as the cache gets more full.
  * `--inference-server-exit-after-one-query` will make the server exit with
    exit code 0 after it has served one HTTP query. This is used for
    troubleshooting and experiments.

Prompts and flags related to token sampling are all ignored in inference server
mode. Instead, they are obtained from each HTTP JSON API request.

### Inference server API

There is an `examples/api_hello_world.py` for a minimal API use example.

```
POST /rllama/v1/inference
```

Expects a JSON body and `Accept: application/json` or `Accept: text/jsonl`.

The expected JSON is as follows:

```
  {
     "temperature":        <number, optional>
     "top_k":              <integer, optional, default 20>
     "top_p":              <number, optional, default: 1.0>
     "repetition_penalty": <number, optional, default: 1.0>
     "stop_at_end_token":  <bool, optional, default: true>
     "max_seq_len":        <integer, optional, default: 1024. Clamped to
                            be at highest the same as --max-seq-len command line option.>
     "max_new_tokens":     <integer, optional, default: 1024>
     "no_token_sampling":  <bool, optional, default: false>
     "prompt":             <string, required>
  }
```

The form of the response depends on if `no_token_sampling` is set to true or false. The
response is in JSONL, i.e. multiple JSON dictionaries, separated by newlines.

`no_token_sampling` can turn off `rllama`'s own token sampling. In this case,
the probabilities for every token are returned instead.

When no\_token\_sampling = false:

```
{<token string>: {"p": <number>, "is_end_token": bool, might not be present}}
```

  * `token` contains the new token to be appended to output. It does not
    include string you fed to the system originally.
  * `p` is the probability that this token was chosen. For example, if this
    value is 0.1, it means that this particular token had 10% chance of being
    selected with the current token sampling settings.
  * `is_end_token` is `true` is the given token signifies end of output. This
    field is not present otherwise.

When no\_token\_sampling = true:

```
{<token string>: {"p": <number>, "is_end_token": bool, might not be present} \
,<token string>: {"p": <number>, "is_end_token": bool, might not be present} \
,...}
```

If you want to implement your own token sampling, you may want to set
`max_new_tokens=1` and `stop_at_end_token=false` to suppress rllama's own
sampling behavior entirely.

`rllama` internally caches recently queried prompts and the intermediate
computations so that it's able to continue off quickly if you issue a query
that is either the same as a previous query or a continuation of one.

## How to turn on OpenCL

Use `opencl` Cargo feature.

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+sse2,+avx,+fma,+avx2" cargo install rllama --features opencl
```

```
rllama --tokenizer-path /path/to/tokenizer.model \
       --model-path /path/to/LLaMA/7B \
       --param-path /path/to/LLaMA/7B/params.json \
       --opencl-device 0 \
       --prompt "The meaning of life is"
```

With `opencl` feature, there is also another argument, `--opencl-device` that
takes a number. That number selects Nth OpenCL device found on the system. You
can see the devices in the output when you run the program (e.g. see the
screenshot below).

Weights are always cast to 16-bit floats for OpenCL.

## Notes and future plans

This is a hobby thing for me so don't expect updates or help.

* Some other CPU implementations use quantization to reduce the size of weights
  and generally speed up everything a lot. `rllama` does not have this.
* I've heard there is some thing called Tensor Cores on nVidia GPUs. Not
  accessible with OpenCL. But might be accessible on Vulkan with a an
  extension.
* More sophisticated token sampling. I saw on Hackernews some comments how the
  samplers included in Facebook's reference code are kinda garbage and you can
  get much better results with good defaults and things like repetition
  penalty.
* There is an initial start-up time as the program has to pass through the
  initial prompt. I don't know if this start-up time can be eliminated
  completely but it could be cached on disk. Use cases like having a standard
  prompt to prime the text generation that you reuse many times.
* Stanford released some instruct-finetuned LLaMA-7B, once I find the weights
  then I'd like to try make a chat-like command-line interface.

## Benchmarks

I'm trying to track that I'm making this faster and not slower.

For 50-length sequence generation:

```
cargo run --release --
          --model-path /LLaMA/13B \
          --param-path /LLaMA/13B/params.json \
          --tokenizer-path /LLaMA/tokenizer.model \
          --prompt "Computers are pretty complica" --max-seq-len 50
